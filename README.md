# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview:
- Developed a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.
- Analyzed passenger data, visualized patterns, and selected relevant features.
- Trained various classifiers including SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Achieved a maximum accuracy of XX% on the validation dataset.

## Data Exploration:
- Explored the Titanic dataset to understand feature distributions and relationships.
- Visualized survival rates by gender, passenger class, age group, and more.
- Handled missing values and engineered new features based on insights.

## Model Training and Evaluation:
- Utilized various classifiers and evaluated performance using cross-validation.
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters and selected the best-performing model.
- Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Deployment:
- Deployed the best model for predicting survival on new passenger data.
- Created a submission file in CSV format for Kaggle competition.

## Technologies Used:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for building and evaluating machine learning models.
